\chapter*{\Large \center Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr. Siobh√°n North for her guidance and incredible feedback throughout this project. Without her guidance, I would not have been able to complete this work as well as her assistance with finishing my degree. I would also like to thank all the friends I have made here, some of whom have fundamentally changed my life for the better and the way I view the world. Finally I would like to thank both my parents for their continued support and believing in me despite the struggles of the year. They continue to give me the courage and strength to be able to do what I love and helped me throughout the year with mental well being.
