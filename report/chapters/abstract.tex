\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

The University currently only provides a paper-based system for students to submit extenuating circumstance forms to their respective departments. This system is both inefficient and error prone for causing great amounts of stress and additional work for both students and staff alike. This work attempts to develop a working prototype of a online system to gather user feedback in order to assess what would be necessary for a minimum viable system as well as if there is a great demand to replace the headaches caused by the paper system or if there is a better usage for University resources to pursue solving other more pressing issues. The findings show that while the provided prototype did give an incredibly seamless and fluid user experience, there were a few critical missing features for users that would be needed in order to deploy it to a full production environment. The current solution however, was also found to vastly outperform the paper system and was weighed to be completely desirable over the paper system currently provided.
